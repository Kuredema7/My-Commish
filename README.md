# My Commish App
### Know Your Worth. The commission app keeps you in control
<p>
Spreadsheets got you down? <br>
I built <strong><em>My Commish</em></strong>, a commission tracker app because I was tired of confusing spreadsheets and unreliable mental math like you. 
It lets you boost your earnings and track your daily and monthly income effortlessly. 
Now you can focus on closing deals and <strong><em>My Commish</em></strong> will handle the rest.
